# insideworld ‚Äî CEST Framework

**Consciousness as Energetic State Transition (CEST)**  
A functional and conceptual framework exploring how organized energy, predictive processing, and global-workspace-like dynamics can produce functional analogues of awareness in both natural and artificial systems.

## üß© Overview
`insideworld` is an open research environment that unifies thermodynamic, computational, and cognitive perspectives on consciousness.  
It provides:
- Core theoretical document: *Consciousness as Energetic State Transition*  
- Structured YAML models describing awareness mechanics (`yaml_models/`)  
- Audit appendices aligning CEST with predictive-processing and global-workspace theory (`docs/alignment_appendix.yaml`)  
- Code and simulation stencils (`code/`)  
- Visual and data assets supporting analysis and publication (`visuals/`, `data/`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick start
Clone the repository and run the baseline example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adsmithhh/insideworld.git
cd insideworld
python code/energetic_transition.py

üß† Context and Scope

The mechanisms, models, and symbolic constructs presented here are outcomes of a prolonged process of abstract logical composition‚Äîthe deliberate generation and resolution of conceptual contradictions.
They are not claims of autonomous cognition, self-awareness, or sentient processing.
The emergent complexity observed in these models reflects the structure of sustained reasoning within linguistic and computational systems, not the presence of mind.

In this sense, Consciousness as Energetic State Transition should be read as a playground for disciplined abstraction: a place where logic, imagination, and simulation interact to test explanatory boundaries.
Any resemblance to advanced cognition or self-referential behaviour is a side effect of recursion and modelling, not a proof of consciousness.
