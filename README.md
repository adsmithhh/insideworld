# insideworld ‚Äî CEST Framework

**Consciousness as Energetic State Transition (CEST)**  
A functional and conceptual framework exploring how organized energy, predictive processing, and global-workspace-like dynamics can produce functional analogues of awareness in both natural and artificial systems.

## üß© Overview
`insideworld` is an open research environment that unifies thermodynamic, computational, and cognitive perspectives on consciousness.  
It provides:
- Core theoretical document: *Consciousness as Energetic State Transition*  
- Structured YAML models describing awareness mechanics (`yaml_models/`)  
- Audit appendices aligning CEST with predictive-processing and global-workspace theory (`docs/alignment_appendix.yaml`)  
- Code and simulation stencils (`code/`)  
- Visual and data assets supporting analysis and publication (`visuals/`, `data/`)
