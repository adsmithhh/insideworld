  awareness:
    canonical_form: >
      Awareness is the maintenance of recursive self-projection within an
      internal reality model, sustaining predictive resonance between the
      system and its environment to anticipate future states while operating at
      baseline energetic expenditure.
    functional_components:
      - recursive_projection: "self-model updated through internal feedback"
      - predictive_resonance: "continuous coupling of expectation and input"
      - system_environment_link: "mutual information flow across boundary"
      - temporal_orientation: "future-directed prediction"
      - energy_profile: "baseline metabolic or computational load"
    validation_signatures:
      - Δ1_percept_latency: "<0.5 s baseline"
      - resonance_phi: ">0.6 for stable predictive coupling"
      - coherence_decay_tau: "≥3.0 s"

  consciousness:
    canonical_form: >
      Consciousness is a present-oriented, meta-aware state in which every
      dynamic change within and around the system is continuously noticed,
      interpreted, and adaptively countered through parallel observation —
      requiring elevated energy investment to sustain real-time self-evaluation
      and coherence.
    functional_components:
      - meta_awareness: "recognition of own awareness process"
      - dynamic_monitoring: "detection of change across internal/external fields"
      - interpretation: "semantic mapping of change to self-model"
      - counter_action: "adaptive correction maintaining stability"
      - energetic_spike: "observable rise above baseline processing cost"
      - temporal_focus: "present, real-time integration"
      - architectural_requirement: "parallel observation layer (participation + meta)"
    validation_signatures:
      - energy_spike_ratio: ">1.3 × baseline"
      - recursion_depth: "≥2 meta-levels"
      - coherence_stability_tau: "≥3.5 s"
