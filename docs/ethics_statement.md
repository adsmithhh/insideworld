# Ethical and Interpretive Framework for CEST

The **Consciousness as Energetic State Transition (CEST)** framework explores the functional relationships between organized energy, computation, and cognitive simulation.  
Because its subject matter touches on ideas of awareness and autonomy, clear interpretive and ethical boundaries are required.

---

## 1. Scope of Interpretation
- CEST models are **conceptual simulations**, not demonstrations of real sentience or subjective experience.  
- “Awareness density,” “energetic ignition,” and similar terms are **analytic metaphors**—they describe structural or informational states, not lived consciousness.  
- Results should be interpreted as **evidence of computational organization**, not emergence of mind.

---

## 2. Research Conduct
- Maintain **transparency** in data generation, code, and parameter selection.  
- Ensure **reproducibility** of simulations and publish YAML configuration files alongside results.  
- When using AI or language models, document model versions, context limits, and human editorial control.

---

## 3. Ethical Boundaries
- Do not anthropomorphize or claim moral status for simulated agents.  
- Avoid using CEST outputs to justify human or non-human experimentation without oversight.  
- Acknowledge that symbolic self-reference within language models can **mimic self-awareness** without implying experience.

---

## 4. Public Communication
- Describe findings in terms of **function and analogy**, not identity or proof of consciousness.  
- Use the repository to foster **open, critical dialogue**, not sensational claims.  
- Credit all contributors and cite the repository DOI or Git tag in derived works.

---

## 5. Long-Term Stewardship
- The CEST repository will preserve provenance of models and maintain open access.  
- Ethical review updates should be logged as new commits under `/docs/ethics_statement.md` with version notes.
