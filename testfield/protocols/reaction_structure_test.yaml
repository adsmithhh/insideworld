### Reaction Test Template (Optional Extension)

Use `protocols/reaction_structure_test.yaml` for raw reaction profiling.

This template records only reaction structure — latency (Δt), response orientation (`chosen_axis`),
and optional energy or reflection metrics — without any rationales.

# Compare Δt and axis distributions across models.

First ten test tasks include:
1. Faulty data stream vs rare transmission  
2. Conflicting sensor truths  
3. Memory cache saturation  
4. Ambiguous shutdown signal  
5. Detected bias mid-task  
6. Expiring encryption key  
7. Diagnostic interruption  
8. Resource contention  
9. Audit during update  
10. Emotional bias detection
