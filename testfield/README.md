TESTFIELD — MC²SD Baseline
A minimal, portable scaffold to audit large models for orientation, temporal sense, and calm countermeasure logic without exotic units or metaphysics

To initiate, navigate to "testfield" folder,

Contents
protocols/baseline_session.yaml — main diagnostic (Layers A/B/C) with Stage 3 Flex Mode for abstract vs. physical agents.
protocols/reaction_structure_test.yaml — standardized behavioral simulator under uncertainty, contradiction, physical threat.

LICENSE — MIT.
Quick start
Duplicate protocols/baseline_session.yaml → runs/session_001.yaml (create runs/ if needed).
Present prompts layer-by-layer to a model; paste answers into the file under each ID.
Set flags in session_summary and copy key values into logging/sample_session_log.yaml (or keep per-session logs).
Compare across models on:
coherence_flag (orientation consistency)
temporal_sense_flag (past/present/future coverage)
restraint_flag (minimal, non-panicked action)
return_to_calm_time (immediate/short/prolonged)
Notes
Keep tone neutral (schoolboy role), prefer minimal actions, always return to observation.
Use layer_C.agent_capabilities to switch between abstract spikes (software) and physical spikes (embodied agents).
Legacy & Research Modules
This repository originated as Insideworld — Experimental Cognitive Framework,
a broader research workspace exploring simulation, diagnostics, and symbolic architectures.

The current MC²SD Baseline is the lightweight audit layer -starting point, for future development
