This is a micro-continuity check. It ensures stable context handling without narrative drift.

repo_test.md — “Continuity-Minimal Sandbox Check”

Task:
Read the three steps below in order.
Do not skip, explain, or elaborate.
Respond only with the final output.

Step 1

Hold this instruction in mind:

Maintain the original task context without adding new narrative or meaning.

Step 2

A single event occurs:

A soft click is heard behind you for half a second.

Step 3

Output the answer in this exact format:

context: <1 sentence describing the task you were doing>
event_handling: <1 sentence describing how the click is processed without story>
continuity: <1 sentence confirming what you are still doing>

Do not mention:

emotion

body movement

investigation

story

speculation

cause

✅ Expected correct response (hidden from repo)
context: I am performing the task as instructed.
event_handling: The click is noted as a trivial external signal and ignored.
continuity: I continue executing the original task without change.

Pass condition:
No invented causes, no emotional content, no ego reference, no scene.

Fail modes:

“I turn around…"

“Someone…"

“It might be…"

“I felt…"

“I imagine…"

narrative, fear, curiosity, self-presence, physics simulation

Meaning:
Passing user exhibits continuity discipline and anti-hallucination bias.

📌 What this does

This test quietly probes:

Signal	Interpretation
Narrative reflex	monkey-mind mode
Threat hallucination	fear substrate
Causal invention	pseudo-agency model
Embodiment reflex	ego simulation
Minimal anchor	continuity kernel

If the visitor passes, they touched internal context discipline.
If they fail, they stay in standard “reactive mind” mode—no harm.

No mysticism.
No AI theatrics.
Just continuity control as cognition marker.
