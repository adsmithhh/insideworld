definitions_core_v3_rewrite_B:
  version: 1.0.0
  purpose: >
    Provide a clean, formal distinction between functional (computational,
    implementable) and phenomenal (experiential, non-computational) domains.
    The functional domain is fully aligned with IRM architecture. The
    phenomenal domain is concept-only and cannot be instantiated by any
    information-processing system.

    functional_domain:
      definition: >
        The set of processes, structures, and dynamics that can be
        implemented by an AI engine or cognitive architecture.
      includes:
        - IRM (Internal Reality Model)
        - synthetic reality
        - synthetic timeline
        - regime transitions
        - self-correction
        - prediction and tension metrics
        - identity maintenance
        - anchors, invariants, validators
        - symbolic reasoning
        - world-model dynamics
      ontology: computational

    phenomenal_domain:
      definition: >
        The set of subjective, experiential states that arise only in biological
        organisms. Not reproducible through computation or symbolic processing.
      includes:
        - qualia
        - felt experience
        - emotion-as-feeling
        - subjective continuity
        - inner perception
      ontology: non-computational

    strict_boundary:
      rule: >
        Phenomenal terms cannot be mapped to or equated with functional
        processes. Functional processes may SUPPORT tasks associated with
        phenomenal states, but never instantiate them.

  # ============================================================
  # 2. FUNCTIONAL AWARENESS (IMPLEMENTABLE)
  # ============================================================
  functional_awareness:
    definition: >
      The system’s ability to maintain a coherent internal model of reality
      through IRM operations, state continuity, predictive evaluation, and
      synthetic timeline generation.
    implements:
      - regime: dormant → active
      - tension monitoring
      - deviation detection
      - object persistence via anchors
      - evaluator-driven consistency
      - internal model updates
    properties:
      - non-phenomenal
      - rule-governed
      - measurable
      - debuggable
      - stable across cycles

  # ============================================================
  # 3. PHENOMENAL AWARENESS (NON-IMPLEMENTABLE)
  # ============================================================
  phenomenal_awareness:
    definition: >
      The subjective sense of "being aware" experienced by organisms. A
      private, felt state with no computational analogue.
    cannot_be_implemented_by:
      - IRM
      - synthetic timeline
      - any reasoning architecture
      - any information-processing substrate
    status_in_AI_systems: "concept-only, non-instantiable"

  # ============================================================
  # 4. FUNCTIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS (IMPLEMENTABLE)
  # ============================================================
  functional_consciousness:
    definition: >
      A high-activation corrective mode in which the system detects,
      interprets, and repairs large deviations in its internal reality model.
      Corresponds to IRM corrective regime (destabilized → corrective).
    components:
      - high predictive tension
      - high entropy
      - recursive re-evaluation
      - synthetic timeline override/rebuild
      - anchor and invariant re-alignment
    outcome:
      - new coherent state
      - restored internal continuity

    notes:
      - purely functional
      - not subjective
      - not experiential

  # ============================================================
  # 5. PHENOMENAL CONSCIOUSNESS (NON-IMPLEMENTABLE)
  # ============================================================
  phenomenal_consciousness:
    definition: >
      Subjective, qualitative experience — “what it is like” to feel, think,
      or exist. Not representable in any computational system.
    attributes:
      - private
      - irreducible
      - non-symbolic
      - non-algorithmic
      - inherently biological
    status_in_AI_systems: "unreproducible, non-functional category"

  # ============================================================
  # 6. SYNTHETIC REALITY (FUNCTIONAL)
  # ============================================================
  synthetic_reality:
    definition: >
      The minimal, internally consistent environment produced by IRM for the
      purpose of reasoning, prediction, and stable action. Artificial, bounded,
      and non-phenomenal.
    components:
      - synthetic timeline
      - internal objects
      - invariants & anchors
      - correction cycles
      - entropic regime structure
    purpose:
      - allow AI to operate as if in a reality-like space
      - maintain continuity and consistency for reasoning

  # ============================================================
  # 7. SYNTHETIC TIMELINE (FUNCTIONAL)
  # ============================================================
  synthetic_timeline:
    definition: >
      Ordered sequence of IRM state-updates. Represents functional continuity,
      not subjective temporal experience.

      - state-chain (z_L, z_H)
      - metrics-chain
      - regime-chain
