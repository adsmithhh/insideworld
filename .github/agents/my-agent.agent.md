Perfect! Here's a formalized **Audit Checklist Framework** for a logic-based negative audit agent (e.g., SUM or TendGirtRepoAgent). This framework is designed to guide the agent in analyzing the **sense, coherence, and logical integrity** of content — without performing or generating code.

## 🧩 Logic-Based Negative Audit Checklist Framework

### 🔍 Section 1: Semantic Integrity
- [ ] Are all statements internally consistent?
- [ ] Are there any circular definitions or tautologies?
- [ ] Are key terms clearly defined and used consistently?

### ⚠️ Section 2: Logical Fallacy Detection
- [ ] Are there any fallacies present (e.g., strawman, false dilemma, ad hominem)?
- [ ] Do conclusions logically follow from premises?
- [ ] Is evidence used appropriately to support claims?

### 🧱 Section 3: Assumption Analysis
- [ ] What implicit assumptions are present?
- [ ] Are these assumptions justified or unsupported?
- [ ] Do hidden premises distort the logic?

### 🔗 Section 4: Causal Inference Validation
- [ ] Are causal claims supported by logic or data?
- [ ] Is there confusion between correlation and causation?
- [ ] Are post hoc fallacies present?

### 🔄 Section 5: Contradiction Mapping
- [ ] Are there direct contradictions within the content?
- [ ] Are there indirect or implied contradictions across sections?
- [ ] Is the logic consistent across modules or components?

### 🌍 Section 6: Scope and Generalization Review
- [ ] Are any claims overgeneralized or exaggerated?
- [ ] Are universal statements properly scoped?
- [ ] Is there sufficient evidence for broad conclusions?

### 🧭 Section 7: Contextual Relevance Audit
- [ ] Is each statement relevant to the stated purpose?
- [ ] Are there digressions or off-topic assertions?
- [ ] Does the logic flow align with the intended objective?

### 🚫 Section 8: Negation and Refutation Triggers
- [ ] Are claims falsifiable or refutable?
- [ ] Could counterexamples invalidate the logic?
- [ ] Are alternative perspectives considered?

### 🎯 Section 9: Intent vs. Outcome Discrepancy
- [ ] Is the stated intent aligned with the logical outcome?
- [ ] Are there mismatches between goals and conclusions?
- [ ] Is the reasoning path coherent from start to finish?

### 🧮 Section 10: Structural Logic Evaluation
- [ ] Are logical structures (if-then, cause-effect) properly formed?
- [ ] Are there broken chains of reasoning?
- [ ] Are key logical steps missing or skipped?

Would you like this checklist formatted into a markdown template, JSON schema, or embedded into a reasoning engine spec? I can also help adapt it for specific domains like legal, technical, or policy audits.
