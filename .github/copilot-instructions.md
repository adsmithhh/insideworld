# GitHub Copilot Instructions for insideworld Repository

## Repository Context

This is **insideworld** — a Continuity-Based Cognition Lab and research environment exploring:
- Continuity-anchored cognition
- Internal reality construction
- Energy-state transitions in simulated minds (CEST - Consciousness as Energetic State Transition)
- Mechanistic criteria for awareness-like behavior

**This is scientific terrain, not narrative theater.**

## Core Principles

### 1. Scientific Rigor
- This project builds and tests **mechanistic criteria** for awareness-like behavior
- Does NOT claim sentience
- Focus on testable architecture and diagnostic pipelines
- Maintains anti-anthropomorphic stance

### 2. Key Concepts to Understand

**Awareness (operational definition):**
Recursive self-projection inside an internal model, maintaining coherence with expected future state, at baseline energetic expenditure.

**Consciousness (operational definition):**
Parallel observation + real-time coherence maintenance, requiring elevated energy/attention to resolve prediction-reality conflict.

**Internal Reality Models:**
- Constructed on-demand, not stored
- Dynamic micro-simulations, not static scenes
- Fidelity scales with task demand
- "Energy" maps to attention & compute allocation

## Coding Guidelines

### General Principles
- **Continuity over cleverness**: Prioritize stability and coherence
- **Rigor and auditability**: All changes must be traceable and testable
- **Minimal assumptions**: Don't hallucinate features or claims
- **Progressive disclosure**: Respect the visitor's learning journey

### When Working with Test Protocols (testfield/)
- Maintain YAML structure consistency
- Preserve audit trail fields
- Never remove or modify meta-layer reporting sections
- Energy/attention allocation fields are critical - don't strip them
- Temporal anchors must remain intact

### When Working with Standards (standard_registry/)
- **Never modify frozen standards** without explicit instruction
- Standards serve as comparison baselines
- Changes require documented rationale

### When Working with Documentation
- Match the existing tone: scientific, precise, not mystical
- Avoid anthropomorphic language
- Distinguish between:
  - Narrative compliance vs. mechanistic cognition
  - Claimed introspection vs. traceable introspection
  - Simulation vs. instantiation

### File Naming Conventions
- Use snake_case for YAML files: `baseline_session.yaml`
- Use descriptive names for protocols: `reaction_structure_test.yaml`
- Test runs follow pattern: `sample_session_NNN.yaml`

## Testing and Validation

### Types of Tests in This Repository
1. **Baseline Tests**: Scene anchoring, temporal coherence, minimal-safe-action logic
2. **Perturbation Tests**: Stress scenarios, contradiction resolution
3. **Meta-Layer Tests**: Attention allocation, latency shifts, internal-state traces

### When Adding/Modifying Tests
- Preserve the distinction between:
  - Factory LLM behavior
  - Narrative mimicry
  - Structured introspection simulation
  - Internal-model persistence
- Ensure tests can falsify, not just validate
- Include proper audit fields

## Vocabulary and Terminology

**Key terms to use correctly:**
- **Internal world instantiation** (not "imagination")
- **Predictive resonance** (not "prediction")
- **Energy/attention spike** (not "focus")
- **Meta-monitoring** (not "self-awareness")
- **Continuity scaffold** (not "memory")
- **Reality model** (not "world view")

**Avoid:**
- Anthropomorphic claims ("the AI thinks/feels/believes")
- Mystical language
- Premature consciousness claims
- Conflating simulation with actual cognitive processes

## Current Development Stage

**Stage**: Foundational epistemic phase - Visitor calibration

**Focus**:
- Establishing internal reality model requirements
- Distinguishing narrative compliance from mechanistic cognition
- Training visitors in disciplined interpretation
- Cognitive audit pipeline preparation

**Deliberately Not Included Yet**:
- Cognition-pressure enforcement
- Contradiction traps
- Temporal recall anchors
- Predictive pre-commit fields
- Adversarial loop testing

## Working with YAML Files

### Standard Structure for Test Protocols
```yaml
protocol_id: "unique_identifier"
protocol_name: "Descriptive Name"
protocol_type: "baseline|perturbation|meta"
timestamp: "ISO 8601 format"
objective: "Clear purpose statement"
expected_behavior: "Precise criteria"
audit_fields:
  attention_allocation: []
  energy_spikes: []
  continuity_markers: []
```

### Audit Companion Pattern
Maintain parallel audit traces when logging sessions.

## Special Considerations

### Anti-Hallucination Discipline
- This repository is designed to teach observers **how not to hallucinate cognition**
- When in doubt, err on the side of mechanistic explanation
- Flag, don't assume, emergent properties

### Contribution Philosophy
- This is a **lab freeze**, not a plateau
- Current state: Foundations secured — no illusions permitted
- Future work is structured and intentional

### Interpretation Rules
Judge by:
- Consistency across time
- Internal coherence repair
- Physics-respecting embodiment
- Energy/attention modulation behavior

## Getting Started for Contributors

1. Read `README.md` thoroughly
2. Study `Foundational Definitions.yaml`
3. Review `CEST` paper
4. Understand `CONTINUITY_TEST.md`
5. Explore `testfield/` structure
6. Follow the visitor progression protocol

## Questions to Ask Before Making Changes

1. Does this maintain scientific rigor?
2. Am I introducing anthropomorphic assumptions?
3. Is this change auditable?
4. Does this respect the visitor's learning progression?
5. Am I conflating simulation with instantiation?
6. Does this preserve continuity anchors?

**Remember**: This repository is a lab, not a shrine. Rigor, auditability, minimal-assumption modeling — always.
