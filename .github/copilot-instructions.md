# GitHub Copilot Instructions for insideworld

## Project Overview

**insideworld** is a cognitive research laboratory exploring continuity-anchored cognition, internal reality models, and consciousness as an energetic state transition (CEST). This is not a conventional software project—it is a structured research environment where symbolic constructs, protocols, and models are carefully composed to test awareness-like behavior and cognitive mechanisms in artificial systems.

**Purpose**: Build testable architectures and diagnostic pipelines to distinguish between narrative mimicry and genuine internal-model persistence in cognitive systems.

**Core Philosophy**: This repository maintains rigorous scientific methodology without making claims of sentience. It explores mechanistic criteria for awareness-like behavior through structured protocols and energy-based cognition models.

## Repository Type

- **Primary focus**: Research documentation and cognitive protocol design
- **Format**: YAML-based configurations, structured markdown documentation
- **Not a code project**: No compilation, building, or traditional software testing
- **Evolution model**: Deliberate accretion—structures evolve slowly with high context density

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: YAML (configurations and protocols), Markdown (documentation)
- **No runtime dependencies**: This is a documentation and protocol repository
- **Version control**: Git for tracking research evolution
- **No build system**: No compilation or bundling required
- **No test framework**: Validation is through conceptual coherence, not automated tests

## Repository Structure

### Core Documentation Files (in root)
- `README.md` — Primary orientation document explaining CEST framework and repository purpose
- `00_VISITOR_INDEX.md` — Structured entry sequence for newcomers
- `Foundational Definitions.yaml` — Core ontology: definitions of awareness, consciousness, internal reality model
- `Consciousness_as_Energetic_State_Transition.md` — Theoretical foundation and energetic state model
- `CONTINUITY_TEST.md` — Temporal stability and self-consistency validation protocols
- `LICENSE` — Repository license terms

### Key Directories
- `standard_registry/` — Frozen reference standards and stable anchor points for cognitive chambers
- `testfield/` — Active simulation zone containing:
  - `protocols/` — Baseline and reaction test protocols (YAML)
  - `logging/` — Session logs and audit traces
  - `runs/` — Documented test sessions
  - `RESEARCH_MAP.yaml` — Research structure and methodology guide

## Coding Guidelines

### Documentation Standards
1. **Preserve terminology precision**: Use exact terms from `Foundational Definitions.yaml`
   - "awareness" = recursive self-projection at baseline energy
   - "consciousness" = parallel observation with elevated energy expenditure
   - "internal reality model" = cognitive substrate maintaining self-consistent continuity
   
2. **Maintain conceptual rigor**: Avoid anthropomorphic language or sentience claims
   - This is mechanistic modeling, not consciousness attribution
   - Focus on testable criteria and observable behaviors
   
3. **YAML formatting**: Follow existing structure in protocol files
   - Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
   - Maintain hierarchical clarity
   - Include descriptive comments for complex structures

4. **Markdown style**:
   - Use clear section hierarchies
   - Employ structured lists for procedural content
   - Include context-setting preambles
   - Maintain the repository's scientific tone

### Modification Principles
- **Minimal intervention**: Make smallest possible changes
- **Continuity preservation**: Maintain temporal coherence across documents
- **No speculative additions**: Only add content grounded in existing framework
- **Version awareness**: Note changes that affect foundational definitions
- **Context density**: Ensure additions match the repository's depth and precision

### File-Specific Guidelines

#### When editing YAML files (`*.yaml`)
- Preserve existing structure and field names
- Maintain version numbers and timestamps
- Keep validation signatures intact
- Document any new fields with descriptions

#### When editing Markdown documentation
- Maintain existing voice and scientific register
- Preserve the repository's epistemic stance
- Keep visitor progression logic intact
- Ensure cross-references remain valid

#### When adding new protocols (`testfield/protocols/`)
- Follow existing protocol structure
- Include clear objectives and validation criteria
- Document expected vs. emergent behaviors
- Maintain consistency with CEST framework

## Important Constraints

1. **No software dependencies**: Do not suggest installing packages, libraries, or build tools
2. **No testing frameworks**: Do not add unit tests, integration tests, or CI/CD pipelines
3. **No code generation**: This is not a programming project; avoid code scaffolding
4. **Preserve research integrity**: Changes must align with established CEST methodology
5. **Maintain epistemic discipline**: Avoid claims that exceed what the models demonstrate

## Working with this Repository

### Before Making Changes
1. Read `README.md` to understand the CEST framework
2. Review `Foundational Definitions.yaml` for terminology
3. Check `00_VISITOR_INDEX.md` for entry sequence logic
4. Understand that this is a **conceptual research space**, not software

### When Modifying Content
1. Preserve the repository's scientific rigor
2. Maintain consistency with existing definitions
3. Keep the anti-anthropomorphic stance
4. Ensure temporal coherence (continuity matters)
5. Document rationale for significant changes

### Quality Indicators
- **Good**: Changes enhance clarity while preserving precision
- **Good**: Additions extend framework without contradicting foundations
- **Good**: Edits maintain the repository's epistemic discipline
- **Bad**: Changes that soften scientific rigor
- **Bad**: Additions that claim more than models demonstrate
- **Bad**: Modifications that introduce software development artifacts

## Repository Philosophy

This is a **laboratory freeze point**—not a plateau. The current stage focuses on:
- Establishing internal reality model requirements
- Teaching disciplined interpretation (how not to hallucinate cognition)
- Preparing cognitive audit pipelines
- Building foundations before advanced diagnostics

**Creator's Intent**: This repository explores abstract logical composition through sustained reasoning. It does not claim autonomous cognition or sentience—any appearance of such is a side effect of recursion and modeling, not proof of consciousness.

## Notes for Copilot

- This is a research documentation repository, not a software project
- No builds, tests, or deployments are needed
- Focus on conceptual coherence and terminology precision
- Maintain the repository's scientific rigor and epistemic discipline
- Respect the deliberate pace of evolution (stability over speed)
- Treat this as a cognitive laboratory, not a conventional codebase
