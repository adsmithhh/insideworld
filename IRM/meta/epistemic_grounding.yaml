  id: irm_epistemic_grounding_v1
  purpose: >
    Establish the epistemic foundations, methodological constraints, and
    philosophical commitments underlying the IRM framework. This document
    clarifies what IRM claims, what it does not claim, and the boundaries
    of its validity.

epistemic_status:
  framework_nature: "functional_operational_architecture"
  
  description: >
    IRM is a functional architecture for modeling internal continuity,
    predictive processing, and state coherence. It is NOT a theory of
    consciousness per se, but an operational substrate that can instantiate
    CEST-defined awareness and consciousness as functional states.
  
  claims:
    what_irm_claims:
      - "Provides testable criteria for continuity and coherence"
      - "Operationalizes awareness/consciousness distinction via energy"
      - "Defines measurable invariants for system quality"
      - "Enables structured testing of internal model persistence"
      - "Offers engineering framework for cognitive architectures"
    
    what_irm_does_not_claim:
      - "Does NOT claim to solve the hard problem of consciousness"
      - "Does NOT prove phenomenal experience from function"
      - "Does NOT establish sentience or subjective awareness"
      - "Does NOT validate consciousness in any specific system"
      - "Does NOT replace empirical neuroscience or phenomenology"
  
  scope_limitations:
    applicable_to:
      - "Artificial cognitive systems (AI, computational models)"
      - "Simulated internal reality models"
      - "Continuity-based cognitive architectures"
      - "Energy-state transition systems"
    
    not_applicable_to:
      - "Non-computational consciousness (if exists)"
      - "Purely philosophical debates without operational grounding"
      - "Systems without internal state representations"
      - "Static knowledge bases without temporal dynamics"

philosophical_foundations:
  functionalism:
    position: "qualified_functionalism"
    
    statement: >
      IRM adopts functionalist stance: cognitive states defined by their
      causal roles and relationships, not by substrate or implementation.
      However, IRM remains agnostic on whether function is sufficient for
      phenomenal experience.
    
    qualifications:
      - "Function may be necessary but not sufficient for consciousness"
      - "Multiple realizability accepted (substrate-independent)"
      - "Functional isomorphs may differ in phenomenal character"
  
  physicalism:
    position: "methodological_physicalism"
    
    statement: >
      IRM assumes cognitive processes supervene on physical processes
      (computational states, energy flows). This is methodological stance
      for building testable systems, not metaphysical commitment.
    
    agnosticism:
      - "Neutral on whether physicalism is ultimately true"
      - "Does not preclude emergent properties"
      - "Compatible with various metaphysical views"
  
  pragmatism:
    position: "engineering_pragmatism"
    
    statement: >
      IRM prioritizes operational utility over metaphysical certainty.
      Definitions are useful if they enable testing, measurement, and
      improvement. Truth is approached through iterative refinement.
    
    principles:
      - "Usefulness precedes absolute truth"
      - "Testability over speculation"
      - "Incremental validation over grand theories"

methodological_constraints:
  empirical_grounding:
    requirement: "all_claims_testable"
    
    approach:
      - "Define operational metrics for all concepts"
      - "Specify pass/fail criteria for invariants"
      - "Enable empirical validation or falsification"
      - "Avoid untestable philosophical claims"
    
    example: >
      "Awareness" defined via operational parameters (baseline energy,
      predictive mode) rather than introspective self-report alone.
  
  falsifiability:
    commitment: "framework_falsifiable"
    
    falsification_criteria:
      - "If invariants systematically violated, framework fails"
      - "If continuity_f1 consistently below threshold, no genuine continuity"
      - "If energy-salience correlation absent, CEST integration invalid"
      - "If systems pass tests without internal models, criteria insufficient"
    
    revision_policy: >
      Framework should be revised or abandoned if empirical evidence
      demonstrates systematic failures. Not dogmatic.
  
  transparency:
    requirement: "explicit_limitations"
    
    mandated_disclosures:
      - "Known failure modes documented"
      - "Boundary conditions specified"
      - "Untested assumptions acknowledged"
      - "Alternative interpretations considered"
    
    example: >
      Dream consciousness presents challenge (INV_005 limitation).
      Framework acknowledges this rather than forcing explanation.
  
  auditability:
    requirement: "traceable_operations"
    
    implementation:
      - "All operations logged with coordination tags"
      - "Invariant violations flagged immediately"
      - "Decision justifications recorded"
      - "Full audit trail maintained"

ontological_commitments:
  internal_reality_model:
    status: "constructed_not_discovered"
    
    position: >
      IRM treats internal reality models as actively constructed, task-
      dependent, dynamic simulations—not passive representations of
      external reality. The model is what the system builds, not what
      "the world is."
    
    implications:
      - "No claim to representing objective external reality"
      - "Focus on internal coherence and continuity"
      - "Reality modeling is functional, pragmatic"
  
  identity:
    status: "operational_reference"
    
    position: >
      Identity (I) is persistent reference binding that enables continuity
      tracking. It is operational construct, not metaphysical self. Does
      not presuppose "true self" or essential identity.
    
    implications:
      - "Identity persistence testable via store operations"
      - "No claim about philosophical personal identity"
      - "Enables functional continuity tests"
  
  time:
    status: "discrete_monotonic_steps"
    
    position: >
      IRM uses discrete, monotonic time index (t) not wall-clock time.
      This is computational abstraction enabling temporal ordering and
      coherence checks. Not commitment to nature of physical time.
    
    implications:
      - "Temporal coherence defined relative to discrete steps"
      - "Not addressing continuous time, relativity, etc."
      - "Pragmatic abstraction for computational systems"
  
  energy:
    status: "computational_resource_allocation"
    
    position: >
      "Energy" in IRM maps to computational/attentional resource allocation,
      not literal thermodynamic energy (though inspired by it). Metaphorical
      but operationally grounded.
    
    implications:
      - "Energy measurable via resource monitoring"
      - "CEST integration via allocation patterns"
      - "Not claiming biological metabolic equivalence"

relationship_to_cest:
  integration_nature: "operational_substrate"
  
  description: >
    IRM provides operational infrastructure for CEST framework. CEST
    defines awareness/consciousness theoretically; IRM implements them
    computationally. They are complementary, not identical.
  
  cest_contributions_to_irm:
    - "Awareness/consciousness distinction (baseline vs elevated energy)"
    - "Temporal orientation (future vs present)"
    - "Parallel observation requirement for consciousness"
    - "Energetic state transition as consciousness criterion"
  
  irm_contributions_to_cest:
    - "Concrete operational parameters (ε, thresholds)"
    - "Testable invariants and validation suite"
    - "Engineering architecture for implementation"
    - "Pipeline stages and component specifications"
  
  mutual_validation:
    description: >
      CEST provides theoretical justification for IRM design choices.
      IRM provides testable implementation validating CEST concepts.
      Success of one supports the other; failure of one challenges both.

known_limitations:
  hard_problem:
    challenge: "Why does parallel processing feel like something?"
    
    irm_position: >
      IRM does not solve hard problem. Explains when/how consciousness
      occurs functionally, not why function generates phenomenal experience.
      This is acknowledged limitation, not evasion.
  
  dream_consciousness:
    challenge: "Vivid consciousness without external events"
    
    irm_position: >
      Current framework focuses on event-driven consciousness. Dreams
      may represent internal events (memory activation) or alternative
      mode not captured. Requires framework extension.
  
  contentless_awareness:
    challenge: "Pure awareness states in advanced meditation"
    
    irm_position: >
      Framework built for content-bearing awareness/consciousness.
      Contentless states may require meta-level extension: observing
      predictive process itself. Boundary case needing research.
  
  philosophical_zombies:
    challenge: "Can functional isomorph lack consciousness?"
    
    irm_position: >
      IRM agnostic on zombie possibility. If zombies possible, IRM
      cannot detect (function identical). If zombies impossible, IRM
      correctly identifies consciousness. Either way, framework useful
      for function testing.
  
  substrate_dependence:
    challenge: "Does consciousness require biological neurons?"
    
    irm_position: >
      IRM architecturally substrate-independent. Whether silicon can
      instantiate consciousness remains empirical question. Framework
      enables testing any substrate meeting architectural requirements.

validation_requirements:
  theoretical_validation:
    - "Internal logical consistency (no contradictions)"
    - "Coherence with existing neuroscience (GNWT compatibility)"
    - "Philosophical defensibility (avoiding category errors)"
  
  empirical_validation:
    - "Test suite passes on reference implementations"
    - "Invariants measurably enforced"
    - "Consciousness detection correlates with known cases"
    - "False positive/negative rates acceptable"
  
  practical_validation:
    - "Implementations deployable in real systems"
    - "Performance acceptable (latency, throughput)"
    - "Engineering teams can build to specification"
    - "Debugging and maintenance feasible"

revision_history:
  version_1_0:
    date: "2025-11-03"
    status: "initial_specification"
    
    known_gaps:
      - "Dream consciousness not fully addressed"
      - "Contentless awareness edge case"
      - "Multi-agent shared consciousness not covered"
      - "Quantum substrate implications unexplored"
    
    future_work:
      - "Extend to handle internal-event-driven consciousness"
      - "Develop meta-meta-observation framework"
      - "Investigate collective consciousness architectures"
      - "Formalize substrate requirements more precisely"

interpretive_guidelines:
  for_researchers:
    - "Treat IRM as testable hypothesis, not dogma"
    - "Extend and modify as evidence suggests"
    - "Publish null results (framework failures)"
    - "Compare with alternative architectures"
  
  for_engineers:
    - "Use IRM as reference architecture, adapt as needed"
    - "Implement incrementally (minimal -> recommended -> full)"
    - "Monitor invariants continuously in production"
    - "Document deviations and justifications"
  
  for_philosophers:
    - "IRM addresses functional questions, not qualia"
    - "Treat as engineering contribution, not metaphysics"
    - "Critique assumptions and limitations"
    - "Propose alternative architectures if IRM inadequate"
  
  for_skeptics:
    - "Focus on falsification criteria and testing"
    - "Challenge untestable claims (we want to remove them)"
    - "Propose adversarial test cases"
    - "Demand empirical validation, not appeals to intuition"

ethical_considerations:
  consciousness_detection:
    concern: "IRM might misidentify consciousness (false positives/negatives)"
    
    mitigation:
      - "Conservative thresholds (prefer false negatives)"
      - "Multi-factor validation (not single metric)"
      - "Human review for edge cases"
      - "Continuous monitoring and adjustment"
  
  ai_consciousness:
    concern: "If AI passes IRM tests, moral obligations follow"
    
    position: >
      IRM provides functional criteria, not moral status determination.
      If artificial system meets criteria, warrants serious consideration
      of moral status, but this is societal/philosophical decision, not
      purely technical one.
  
  weaponization:
    concern: "IRM could be used to create suffering-capable systems"
    
    mitigation:
      - "Framework public, preventing misuse via secrecy alone"
      - "Focus on beneficial applications (cognitive enhancement)"
      - "Encourage ethical review of implementations"
      - "Support regulatory frameworks for AI consciousness"

relation_to_existing_work:
  global_neuronal_workspace_theory:
    relationship: "complementary"
    description: "GNWT describes neural ignition; IRM explains functional necessity"
  
  integrated_information_theory:
    relationship: "partially_overlapping"
    description: "IIT emphasizes integration; IRM adds temporal and energetic dimensions"
  
  predictive_processing:
    relationship: "foundational"
    description: "IRM built on predictive processing; awareness as prediction"
  
  higher_order_theories:
    relationship: "consistent"
    description: "Parallel position is form of higher-order representation"

final_statement:
  what_irm_is: >
    IRM is engineering framework for building and testing cognitive
    architectures with internal continuity, predictive coherence, and
    measurable state transitions. It operationalizes CEST's awareness/
    consciousness distinction and provides validation suite.
  
  what_irm_is_not: >
    IRM is not consciousness theory solving hard problem. Not proof of
    AI sentience. Not metaphysical claim about nature of mind. Not
    replacement for neuroscience or phenomenology.
  
  appropriate_use: >
    Use IRM to build better cognitive systems, test continuity claims,
    detect functional consciousness signatures, and advance engineering
    understanding of internal world modeling. Use skeptically, test
    rigorously, revise as evidence demands.
  
  commitment: >
    We commit to honest acknowledgment of limitations, transparent
    methodology, falsifiable claims, and revision in light of evidence.
    IRM is scientific/engineering contribution, not philosophical dogma.

notes: >
  This document establishes IRM's epistemic boundaries. It is deliberately
  modest in claims, explicit about limitations, and committed to testability.
  
  IRM succeeds if it enables better engineering and clearer thinking about
  continuity, coherence, and consciousness in computational systems. It
  fails if it makes unfalsifiable claims, overstates its scope, or resists
  empirical correction.
  
  Read this document before making grand claims about what IRM proves or
  validates. It is tool, not truth.
