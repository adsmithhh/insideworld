# Visitor Index — insideworld

Welcome. This repository is a structured research space exploring
continuity-anchored cognition, internal reality models, and the
energetic logic of awareness (CEST). It is not a conventional code repo:
it is a live laboratory.

This index provides the correct entry sequence.

## Entry Protocol

1. **Read Orientation**
   → `README.md`
   Purpose: understand intent, cadence, and scope.

2. **Ground in Definitions**
   → `Foundational_Definitions.yaml`
   Purpose: internal vocabulary, symbolic primitives, and ontology boundaries.

3. **Review Theory Core**
   → `Consciousness_as_Energetic_State_Transition.md`
   Purpose: energetic model, state transition logic.

4. **Continuity Foundations**
   → `CONTINUITY_TEST.md`
   Purpose: temporal stability and self-consistency rules.

5. **Observe Frozen References**
   → `standard_registry/`
   Purpose: see stable anchor points and chamber standards.

6. **Enter the Lab**
   → `testfield/`
   Purpose: examine live state, logs, and evolving chambers.

## Rules of Approach

- Move slowly; context density grows.
- Do not assume symbolic structures mirror external ontology.
- Treat this as a cognitive lab, not a software project.
- Continuity matters more than cleverness.
- Interpretation ≠ truth; we work with *functional models*.

## Notes

This space evolves. Files and logic accrete deliberately.
Expect stability, not speed. Expect depth, not spectacle.
